What is this?
This is an updated version of the Improved Build Panel from nlight. That mod was removed from Steam at some point, I have updated the source code and now submit it for those who are suffering from carpal tunnel.

What does it do?
It lets you move and resize the asset window while in game. You can drag and resize it however you want! See the screenshots!
It also supports scrolling via the mouse scroll wheel anywhere in the window. The speed of which will be configurable soon.

How do I use it?
First, as always, BACK. UP. YOUR. SAVE. GAMES.
It only modifies the UI and writes a single xml configuration file. It should not touch or harm your save games. Should is the key thing to keep in mind. So. Backup your save games. Remember, I'm not responsible for whatever happens as a result of your use or lack of use of this mod.

Once that is done, then subscribe, Launch the game, and then activate the mod. When you go into the game, click on one of the supported panels (see below)
At first it won't look very special. There are two critical things you must do.

You MOVE the panel by HOLDING DOWN the *LEFT* Ctrl Key. While still holding down ctrl, LEFT CLICK and HOLD the mouse button down ON AN ASSET THAT IS ENABLED. If you can't buy it yet, then it won't work as a "handle" for moving the window. While you have the LEFT Ctrl Key down, clicking will not select the asset, but turn it into a "handle" to move the window with.
To RESIZE it, there is an icon of two arrows in the bottom right edge of the panel. Just left click on those and while holding down the left mouse button drag the window to resize it. You do not have to hold down CTRL for resizing the window. 


That's it. You can make a small little area or you can stretch the panel almost entirely across the screen! You can make it a horizontal row or vertical row. You can move it around and stretch and shrink it all you want. It's your panel now.
It is compatible with the vanilla version 1.1 patch of the game.

If you decide you like it, please be ever so kind and hit that little thumbs up guy right up there below the screenshot. And click on that little star. It will make him shine. If you do that, puppies and unicorns play in fields together.


Which panels are supported?
It supports all of the build panels except for Unique Building and Monuments. It also supports both zoning as well as district panels. It even supports roads. So now you can have a whole screen full of white icon intersections lol ... Ultimately I hope to be able to let you configure each panel individually. So you can put them wherever you wish, or have the mod ignore specific ones, if you wish.


OMG WILL IT AUTOMAGICALLY GIVE US THUMBNAILS IN OUR ASSETS?!??!
No.


Are there any issues?

It is likely Sapphire and the skins that use it may have an issue with this mod.

I did do a quick, but not thorough test and I only loaded a few assets, modTools, and this mod. Once I fixed a few pieces of the code, I didn't have issues. Since there is way too many
variables for me to test, and more importantly there is a man on reddit who is about to have kittens waiting on me to release this, I decided now was as good a time as any.

I will work to fix any issues that arise with other mods, as best I can.

Are you authorized to put this up?
The original source code that nlight wrote and that I used can be found at his github page under the MIT license. Which means anyone is allowed to do pretty much what they want with the code.
nlight may or may not come back, and even weeks before he left he was trying to offload several mods to others. I'm fairly certain he wouldn't mind, esecially since he selected the MIT license.

Credit and Thanks

    Nlight, for all that he's done including the source code of this mod.
    /u/kalimashookdeday on reddit for the idea and the patience while I hammered away at this all night.
    Bloody Penguin for restoring modTools and some of the other great mods that nLight created for us. Literally could not have done this without modTools.
    Simie for not only the Precision Engineering mod, but also for writing some of the most beautiful code I've seen in 20 years of IT work. I mean pretty not just what it does, but the format and style. It's pretty. Serious.
    Sims Firehouse for his assistance in a few key areas.
    A great many users on reddit.
    Most of all my wife. Who doesn't undestand why I buy games, and then spend almost the entire time "playing" them by making them more fun for others who play them.
